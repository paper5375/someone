This bot was **not** designed for use in large servers. It's probably not a great idea to use it in a server of more than a few members.

If you want to use this bot for yourself:
1. Download the source code.
2. Run `npm i` in the root directory to install dependencies.
3. Create a file called `config.json` in the `src`    folder with the following format:
  ```json
  {
    "token": "your bot token here, as a string",
    "clientId": "your bot's client id here, as a string"
  }
  ```
4. Run `npm run start` to compile and start the bot.
